Since a few years we organize an annual LAN party. This all started like most things, in a small fashion. Together with 50 other members of our study association Thor, we had an awesome weekend in the Gaslab. This was such a great success, that a new LAN was organized the following year. This time however, it was bigger. Now with 100 gamers which were from all over university, the weekend became even more awesome than it was the year before. With competitions for popular games, this was an awesome event, which asked for an even bigger event.
This Year we organize the TesLAN! The TesLAN is a LAN, open to all who want to come and have an awesome weekend. Being in the SSC (student sports centre) we can even get more people to attend, 300! As this the LAN got better each year, this LAN has to be the most awesome LAN ever!
For only €12,50 (€17,50 for non-Thormembers) you can join this event for the whole weekend. This includes: a place to sleep during night hours (don’t forget your sleeping gear), food, a spot for you and your gaming gear and competitions in which you and your friends can participate for big prices (League of Legends, CS Go, etc)!
